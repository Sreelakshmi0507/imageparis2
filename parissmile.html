To commemorate 100 years of the French Revolution, the French government hosted an Exposition Universelle aka International Exposition in 1889 and built the Eiffel Tower to be showcased as a part of the exhibition. The idea was to invite artists and architects to propose their respective ideas for a monument, which was to be constructed on the Champ-de-Mars in Paris, the exposition entrance to Paris. And among the thousands of proposals, it was the idea of Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel that won the race.
